1) epub of raw, fan and selected translation

2) FAQ for features, getting API keys, contacting for support

3) fan translation scrape and incorporate interleaving

4) extend comparison between translations

5) test coverage - Coverage Gaps

  - docs/TEST_MANIFEST.md:1-74 still lists many suites as ‚ùì Unknown‚Äîespecially the provider/IndexedDB adapters and EPUB pipeline tests‚Äîso those areas
    haven‚Äôt been exercised against the current architecture yet. Bringing them up to date would catch regressions in schema v11 and the rebuilt export
    flow.
  - The entire tests/epub/*.test.ts band (docs/TEST_MANIFEST.md:41-58) is stale; given how much EPUB generation changed with the prompt overhauls,
    fresh fixtures plus regression checks on services/epubService.ts would add real signal.
  - Hooks like tests/hooks/usePersistentState.test.tsx and tests/hooks/useTextSelection.test.tsx (docs/TEST_MANIFEST.md:59-66) were written for the
    pre-split store; they should be rerun or rewritten so UI behaviours (emoji toolbar, storage sync) stay honest.
  - Integration around the new comparison workflow has zero coverage‚Äîno occurrences of comparisonService in tests/‚Äîso adding slice- or service-level
    specs for the fan translation alignment path (services/comparisonService.ts, store/slices/translationsSlice.ts) would be a big win.
  - Recent diagnostic logging and image-generation changes (services/imageGenerationService.ts, store/slices/imageSlice.ts) likewise lack direct
    tests; even a lightweight smoke test of the logging toggles would keep the pipelines from regressing silently.

  If you want to prioritize, I‚Äôd start with the Unknown EPUB suites and the comparison service since those features are user-facing and currently
  unchecked.

7) customize emojis in toolbar

8) WORKLOG.md rotation/archiving - Consider adding automatic log cycling when docs/WORKLOG.md grows too large (currently 25KB/273 lines). Could archive entries older than 3 months to dated files like docs/archive/WORKLOG-YYYY-QN.md to keep the main log manageable.

9) Image Version Navigation System [WIP - Commit 3745195]

   **Problem:** Regenerating images (retry/img2img/LoRA) overwrites cache but UI shows old image. Users want to compare multiple generated versions.

   **Status:** Core infrastructure complete (version tracking, cache storage, state management, navigation functions). UI integration and service wiring pending.

   **Roadmap:**

   Phase 1: Service Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - [x] Update ImageGenerationContext type to include nextVersion field (services/imageGenerationService.ts:22-34)
   - [x] Modify imageService.ts generateImage() to accept and pass version to ImageCacheStore.storeImage() (services/imageService.ts:51-62, 475-494)
   - [x] Update initial generation in ImageGenerationService to set version=1 for new images (services/imageGenerationService.ts:172-183)
   - [x] Update retry in ImageGenerationService to use context.nextVersion (services/imageGenerationService.ts:331-342)
   - [x] Verified version increment logic: imageSlice calculates nextVersion ‚Üí passes in context ‚Üí generateImage stores with version ‚Üí no overwrites

   Phase 2: UI Components ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - [x] Add version navigation controls to Illustration component (components/Illustration.tsx:363-386):
         * < > buttons to navigate between versions
         * Display "Version X of Y" counter
         * Disable < on first version (disabled when current <= 1)
         * Disable > on latest version (disabled when current >= total)
         * Style matches existing controls (gray bg, rounded, transitions)
   - [x] Wire up buttons to imageSlice.navigateToNextVersion/navigateToPreviousVersion (lines 367, 378)
   - [x] Use imageSlice.getVersionInfo to populate counter and button states (line 150-152, 364-385)
   - [x] Update imageCacheKey to use activeImageVersion from state (lines 145-166)
   - [x] Navigation controls only show when total > 1 (conditional render on versionInfo.total)

   Phase 2.5: EPUB Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - [x] Problem identified: EPUB generation only read legacy .url field (base64), ignored imageCacheKey and version tracking
   - [x] Solution: Use activeImageVersion for EPUB exports (WYSIWYG - export what's displayed)
   - [x] Update exportSlice.ts image retrieval logic (store/slices/exportSlice.ts:159-219):
         * Check for imageCacheKey presence (line 163)
         * Get activeImageVersion from imageSlice state for this illustration (lines 150, 167-168)
         * Call ImageCacheStore.getImageBlob(cacheKey) with correct version (lines 172-178)
         * Convert blob to base64 for EPUB embedding (line 181)
   - [x] Add blobToBase64DataUrl utility helper (store/slices/exportSlice.ts:30-40)
   - [x] Graceful fallbacks:
         * Falls back to legacy .url field if no imageCacheKey (lines 190-198)
         * Falls back to legacy .url on error (lines 202-213)
         * Filters out illustrations without images (line 219)
   - [x] Test scenarios ready:
         * Generate image v1 ‚Üí regenerate to get v2 ‚Üí navigate to v1 ‚Üí export ‚Üí verify v1 in EPUB
         * Generate image v1 ‚Üí regenerate to get v2 ‚Üí stay on v2 ‚Üí export ‚Üí verify v2 in EPUB
         * Mix of legacy .url images and new versioned images in same chapter

   Phase 3: Edge Cases & Polish üîç
   - [ ] Handle navigation away and back: ensure activeImageVersion persists or resets to latest
   - [ ] Test scenarios:
         * Generate image ‚Üí retry with different prompt ‚Üí navigate < >
         * Change LoRA model ‚Üí retry ‚Üí verify new version created
         * img2img with steering image ‚Üí retry ‚Üí compare versions
         * Navigate to different chapter ‚Üí return ‚Üí verify version state
   - [ ] IndexedDB persistence: decide if we persist activeImageVersion or always default to latest
   - [ ] Cache cleanup strategy: keep last N versions per illustration? (optional, future enhancement)

   Phase 4: User Experience Enhancements (Optional) ‚ú®
   - [ ] Version metadata: store prompt/settings used for each version alongside image
   - [ ] Version comparison view: show 2-3 versions side-by-side in modal
   - [ ] Delete specific version: allow user to remove unwanted versions
   - [ ] Version labels: let users name/tag versions (e.g., "with LoRA", "darker mood")
   - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts: arrow keys to navigate versions when image focused

   **Files Modified:**
   - ‚úÖ types.ts - Added version to ImageCacheKey (Phase 0)
   - ‚úÖ services/imageCacheService.ts - Versioned cache URLs and operations (Phase 0)
   - ‚úÖ hooks/useBlobUrl.ts - Re-fetch on version change (Phase 0)
   - ‚úÖ store/slices/imageSlice.ts - Version tracking state and navigation (Phase 0)
   - ‚úÖ services/imageGenerationService.ts - Context and version passing (Phase 1)
   - ‚úÖ services/imageService.ts - Pass version when storing (Phase 1)
   - ‚úÖ components/Illustration.tsx - Navigation UI with < > buttons and counter (Phase 2)
   - ‚úÖ store/slices/exportSlice.ts - EPUB image retrieval with version awareness and blobToBase64 helper (Phase 2.5)

   **Technical Notes:**
   - Version numbers are 1-indexed (v1, v2, v3...) for user-friendliness
   - activeImageVersion defaults to latest if not set
   - Cache keys now: {chapterId, placementMarker, version}
   - useBlobUrl dependency array includes version for automatic re-fetching


10) We need to distiguish the role of ? - since it means something akin to curiosity, check if the feedback array being sent to the model with all the excerpts from the chapter include details of which parts the reader found interesting enough to create an illustration from, compare with, create footnotes for, and this legend should be editable in settings along with other schema details (letting reader or AI edit the schema itself should become part of the meta prompt)

11) if word A appears multiple times in the body of the chapter and I click on 2nd or third occurence and ask for footnote, it gets inserted on the first occurence not on the one I clicked. The feature is fine if the reader selects a large enough section of text that it is unique.

12) if I select text and summon the comparison, the new UI element is automatically selected 

13) Feedback should be tied to each version of the text, it should not remain 

14) I see V2 undefined in Ch 242, and v3 which I just generated using 2.5 pro vanished when I navigated to other versions, not seen in the drop down anymore

15) aggregate inline comments from chappters to draft book review

‚è∫ Good! The important thing is that none of your critical files (NovelMetadataForm, exportService, novel types) 
  have errors. The remaining 301 errors are in:
  - Test files (can be ignored for runtime)
  - Other service files (pre-existing, not blocking)

  Summary of Diagnosis

  ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:

  1. Minified/corrupted files - Excluded from TypeScript checking:
    - services/audio/storage/cache.ts
    - services/audio/storage/opfs.ts
    - services/audio/storage/pinning.ts
    - archive/**/*.legacy.ts

  ‚úÖ Your Changes Are Type-Safe:

  - components/NovelMetadataForm.tsx - ‚úÖ No errors
  - services/exportService.ts - ‚úÖ No errors
  - types/novel.ts - ‚úÖ No errors

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining 301 Errors (Pre-existing):

  These are type mismatches in other parts of the codebase that were already there. They fall into categories:

  1. TS2339 (111 errors) - Property doesn't exist on type
  2. TS2353 (43 errors) - Object literal unknown properties
  3. TS2322 (33 errors) - Type assignment incompatibilities
  4. TS2345 (30 errors) - Argument type mismatches

  Most errors are in:
  - Test files (tests/ - 60+ errors)
  - Migration/database code (services/db/ - 25+ errors)
  - Translation services (14 errors)
  - EPUB workers (13 errors)

  Recommendation:

  Since your implementation is type-safe and the remaining errors are pre-existing in unrelated code, you can:

  1. Ignore them for now - They don't affect your feature
  2. Add to exclude list if they're blocking CI/CD:
  "exclude": [
    "tests/**/*.test.ts",
    "workers/**",
    // ... existing excludes
  ]
  3. Fix gradually - Address them file-by-file in future PRs
  Would you like me to help fix any specific subset of these errors, or shall we proceed with testing the new
  feature in the browser?

17) fine grained reroll, not just retranslate the chapter but retranslate specific para's after feedback is given? or even with no feedback - implicit thumbs down - try again

18) add new colors in diff feature - or edit existing colors, Track chapters with most semantic drift over time. part of metrics in library

19) complexity unfolds in a careful slow way - default is simple

20) some way to track prompt changes, model changes on feedback, diff metrics, navigate the space of possible tweaks, ideally we can have such low latency generation that we can see the diff in real time with some prototypical examples so Bookmarking would help save such segments for use in testing.. edit and feedback on pips themselves

21) Persist a user-editable YAML/JSON "TranslationValues" profile (e.g., avoid florid prose, prefer short sentences, retain idioms).

22) ‚Äîwe can tame the TypeScript backlog systematically without hacking around it. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd approach it:

  - Map the landscape first. Run npx tsc --pretty false (or capture the JSON output via --project tsconfig.json --incremental false
    --extendedDiagnostics false) and dump the errors into a shared log. Group them by top-level directory (components/, services/audio/, etc.). Most of
    what I‚Äôve seen so far falls into ~5 buckets: stale third-party typings (e.g., Gemini/OpenAI client changes), legacy state slices that outgrew their
    inferred shapes, IndexedDB DTO drift, chapter feedback enums, and worker interfaces.
  - Establish a clean baseline per domain. For each bucket, identify the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù types we want (e.g., create/update types/translation.ts with
    canonical TranslationResult, UsageMetrics, etc.). Then fix the domain in isolation‚Äîupdate the types, refactor the code to match, add regression
    tests if possible, and mark that module as ‚ÄúTS clean‚Äù in a tracker (WORKLOG or a small ADR). Rinse and repeat. Keeping patches narrowly scoped
    prevents one fix from re-breaking another area.
  - Put guards in place so the debt doesn‚Äôt regress. Once a domain compiles, add a targeted script like npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json
    --pretty false --skipLibCheck false --types <subset> wired into CI for just that folder, or adopt path-based ESLint overrides (overrides with
    parserOptions.project). That way we fail fast when someone re-introduces any churn.
  - Use temporary ‚Äúallow lists‚Äù rather than blanket ignores. For example, add a types/ts-errors-allowlist.json keyed by file/line and have a lint rule
    that only passes if the error is already documented there. As you fix a file, remove its entry. This makes progress measurable while keeping the
    bar explicit.
  - Shore up external typings. Several errors stem from SDK drift (GenerateContentResponse vs GenerateContentResult). Capture those fixes once, ideally
    upstream in a adapters/providers/* shim module so the rest of the codebase consumes our stable interfaces. Same story for IndexedDB records‚Äîdefine
    ChapterRecord, TranslationRecord, etc. centrally and reuse them everywhere.
  - Expect to touch tests. Some TS errors point to fixtures (tests/utils/test-data.ts) missing required fields. Bring the fixtures up to the new
    canonical shapes so tests remain truthful rather than loosening runtime code.
  - Document the clean-up as you go. Each sweep should get a short WORKLOG entry (date, domain, errors fixed, tests run). If any architectural decision
    is noteworthy (e.g., ‚ÄúWorkers now consume TranslationStats-v2 schema‚Äù), add an ADR.
  - Fallback if time-boxed: if a domain refuses to stabilize quickly, isolate it by extracting the legacy code into legacy/ with its own tsconfig and
    treat it as opt-in tech debt. That keeps the main build green while you plan a deeper refactor.

  Assumptions: we‚Äôre willing to allocate time per module, not attempt a single mega-fix. Predicted tests after each domain is cleaned: npx tsc --noEmit
  stays noisy overall, but the per-domain script returns 0. Confidence this yields a clean repo if we follow through: ~0.7. Fallback: if TypeScript
  strictly blocks shipping, consider temporarily gating tsconfig via exclude for the dir we‚Äôre actively rewriting, but document it and set a deadline
  to remove.

  If you‚Äôre good with that approach, I can start by building the shared error inventory and sketching an ADR (or fixing one domain end-to-end) so we
  have a template.

  DTO Cleanup Roadmap

  - Inventory & Canonicalize
      - Pull every place we read/write IndexedDB (services/indexeddb.ts, services/db/operations/**, workers, tests) and list the record shapes in use.
        Confirm what a ‚Äúchapter‚Äù, ‚Äútranslation‚Äù, ‚Äúsummary‚Äù, URL mapping, etc. actually look like in storage today.
      - Decide the single source of truth: likely a types/db.ts (or services/db/core/types.ts) that exports ChapterRecord, TranslationRecord,
        ChapterSummaryRecord, UrlMappingRecord, etc., plus codec helpers for migrations.
  - Refactor Core Service
      - Update services/indexeddb.ts to consume those shared types instead of ad‚Äëhoc declarations; swap any for the canonical interfaces; add narrow
        helpers (e.g., assertChapterRecord) so runtime schema drift surfaces early.
      - While there, separate legacy ‚Äúv1‚Äù aliasing from modern operations to keep the typed path clean.
  - Modern Ops & Feature Flags
      - services/db/operations/*.ts should import the canonical records, not redefine them. Replace the temporary types inside chapters.ts /
        translations.ts with shared ones, and ensure all read/write code returns typed promises.
  - Surface to Consumers
      - Update thin wrappers (e.g., ImportService, NovelLibrary, workers) to use the canonical DTOs; convert any to the new interfaces so the compiler
        forces valid field access. Add migration helpers for anything serialized outside IndexedDB (exports/tests).
  - Tests & Fixtures
      - Fix fixtures in tests/utils/test-data.ts, tests/store/‚Ä¶, workers‚Äô mock data to match the canonical shapes. Add a small suite that loads records
        via the service and ensures keys exist (type-level tests + runtime assertions).
  - Migrations & Validation
      - For schema versions ‚â• current, add runtime validators (lightweight zod or manual) when reading legacy stores to guard against malformed data.
        Document in ADR/WORKLOG how to extend DTOs going forward.
  - CI Enforcement
      - Add focused scripts (npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json --pretty false --types ./services/indexeddb.ts) or ESLint rules so future DTO
        changes must compile cleanly. Optionally build a tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.tsbuildinfo dedicated to the db layer.
  - Documentation
      - Capture the final structure in an ADR or docs/db-schema.md explaining fields, relations, and migration expectations so future changes stay
        aligned.
