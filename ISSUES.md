1) epub of raw, fan and selected translation

2) FAQ for features, getting API keys, contacting for support

3) fan translation scrape

4) extend comparison between translations

5) test coverage - Coverage Gaps

  - docs/TEST_MANIFEST.md:1-74 still lists many suites as ‚ùì Unknown‚Äîespecially the provider/IndexedDB adapters and EPUB pipeline tests‚Äîso those areas
    haven‚Äôt been exercised against the current architecture yet. Bringing them up to date would catch regressions in schema v11 and the rebuilt export
    flow.
  - The entire tests/epub/*.test.ts band (docs/TEST_MANIFEST.md:41-58) is stale; given how much EPUB generation changed with the prompt overhauls,
    fresh fixtures plus regression checks on services/epubService.ts would add real signal.
  - Hooks like tests/hooks/usePersistentState.test.tsx and tests/hooks/useTextSelection.test.tsx (docs/TEST_MANIFEST.md:59-66) were written for the
    pre-split store; they should be rerun or rewritten so UI behaviours (emoji toolbar, storage sync) stay honest.
  - Integration around the new comparison workflow has zero coverage‚Äîno occurrences of comparisonService in tests/‚Äîso adding slice- or service-level
    specs for the fan translation alignment path (services/comparisonService.ts, store/slices/translationsSlice.ts) would be a big win.
  - Recent diagnostic logging and image-generation changes (services/imageGenerationService.ts, store/slices/imageSlice.ts) likewise lack direct
    tests; even a lightweight smoke test of the logging toggles would keep the pipelines from regressing silently.

  If you want to prioritize, I‚Äôd start with the Unknown EPUB suites and the comparison service since those features are user-facing and currently
  unchecked.

8) WORKLOG.md rotation/archiving - Consider adding automatic log cycling when docs/WORKLOG.md grows too large (currently 25KB/273 lines). Could archive entries older than 3 months to dated files like docs/archive/WORKLOG-YYYY-QN.md to keep the main log manageable.

9) Image Version Navigation System [WIP - Commit 3745195]

   **Problem:** Regenerating images (retry/img2img/LoRA) overwrites cache but UI shows old image. Users want to compare multiple generated versions.

   **Status:** Core infrastructure complete (version tracking, cache storage, state management, navigation functions). UI integration and service wiring pending.

   **Roadmap:**

   Phase 1: Service Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - [x] Update ImageGenerationContext type to include nextVersion field (services/imageGenerationService.ts:22-34)
   - [x] Modify imageService.ts generateImage() to accept and pass version to ImageCacheStore.storeImage() (services/imageService.ts:51-62, 475-494)
   - [x] Update initial generation in ImageGenerationService to set version=1 for new images (services/imageGenerationService.ts:172-183)
   - [x] Update retry in ImageGenerationService to use context.nextVersion (services/imageGenerationService.ts:331-342)
   - [x] Verified version increment logic: imageSlice calculates nextVersion ‚Üí passes in context ‚Üí generateImage stores with version ‚Üí no overwrites

   Phase 2: UI Components ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - [x] Add version navigation controls to Illustration component (components/Illustration.tsx:363-386):
         * < > buttons to navigate between versions
         * Display "Version X of Y" counter
         * Disable < on first version (disabled when current <= 1)
         * Disable > on latest version (disabled when current >= total)
         * Style matches existing controls (gray bg, rounded, transitions)
   - [x] Wire up buttons to imageSlice.navigateToNextVersion/navigateToPreviousVersion (lines 367, 378)
   - [x] Use imageSlice.getVersionInfo to populate counter and button states (line 150-152, 364-385)
   - [x] Update imageCacheKey to use activeImageVersion from state (lines 145-166)
   - [x] Navigation controls only show when total > 1 (conditional render on versionInfo.total)

   Phase 2.5: EPUB Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - [x] Problem identified: EPUB generation only read legacy .url field (base64), ignored imageCacheKey and version tracking
   - [x] Solution: Use activeImageVersion for EPUB exports (WYSIWYG - export what's displayed)
   - [x] Update exportSlice.ts image retrieval logic (store/slices/exportSlice.ts:159-219):
         * Check for imageCacheKey presence (line 163)
         * Get activeImageVersion from imageSlice state for this illustration (lines 150, 167-168)
         * Call ImageCacheStore.getImageBlob(cacheKey) with correct version (lines 172-178)
         * Convert blob to base64 for EPUB embedding (line 181)
   - [x] Add blobToBase64DataUrl utility helper (store/slices/exportSlice.ts:30-40)
   - [x] Graceful fallbacks:
         * Falls back to legacy .url field if no imageCacheKey (lines 190-198)
         * Falls back to legacy .url on error (lines 202-213)
         * Filters out illustrations without images (line 219)
   - [x] Test scenarios ready:
         * Generate image v1 ‚Üí regenerate to get v2 ‚Üí navigate to v1 ‚Üí export ‚Üí verify v1 in EPUB
         * Generate image v1 ‚Üí regenerate to get v2 ‚Üí stay on v2 ‚Üí export ‚Üí verify v2 in EPUB
         * Mix of legacy .url images and new versioned images in same chapter

   Phase 3: Edge Cases & Polish üîç
   - [ ] Handle navigation away and back: ensure activeImageVersion persists or resets to latest
   - [ ] Test scenarios:
         * Generate image ‚Üí retry with different prompt ‚Üí navigate < >
         * Change LoRA model ‚Üí retry ‚Üí verify new version created
         * img2img with steering image ‚Üí retry ‚Üí compare versions
         * Navigate to different chapter ‚Üí return ‚Üí verify version state
   - [ ] IndexedDB persistence: decide if we persist activeImageVersion or always default to latest
   - [ ] Cache cleanup strategy: keep last N versions per illustration? (optional, future enhancement)

   Phase 4: User Experience Enhancements (Optional) ‚ú®
   - [ ] Version metadata: store prompt/settings used for each version alongside image
   - [ ] Version comparison view: show 2-3 versions side-by-side in modal
   - [ ] Delete specific version: allow user to remove unwanted versions
   - [ ] Version labels: let users name/tag versions (e.g., "with LoRA", "darker mood")
   - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts: arrow keys to navigate versions when image focused

   **Files Modified:**
   - ‚úÖ types.ts - Added version to ImageCacheKey (Phase 0)
   - ‚úÖ services/imageCacheService.ts - Versioned cache URLs and operations (Phase 0)
   - ‚úÖ hooks/useBlobUrl.ts - Re-fetch on version change (Phase 0)
   - ‚úÖ store/slices/imageSlice.ts - Version tracking state and navigation (Phase 0)
   - ‚úÖ services/imageGenerationService.ts - Context and version passing (Phase 1)
   - ‚úÖ services/imageService.ts - Pass version when storing (Phase 1)
   - ‚úÖ components/Illustration.tsx - Navigation UI with < > buttons and counter (Phase 2)
   - ‚úÖ store/slices/exportSlice.ts - EPUB image retrieval with version awareness and blobToBase64 helper (Phase 2.5)

   **Technical Notes:**
   - Version numbers are 1-indexed (v1, v2, v3...) for user-friendliness
   - activeImageVersion defaults to latest if not set
   - Cache keys now: {chapterId, placementMarker, version}
   - useBlobUrl dependency array includes version for automatic re-fetching
