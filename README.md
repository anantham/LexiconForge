## 🚀 Getting Started

### The Easy Way: Use the Live Version
The easiest way to start is with the official hosted version on Vercel. No installation required!

**[➡️ Click here to launch LexiconForge](https://lexicon-forge.vercel.app/)**

If you’d like a guided setup, tailored prompts, or bespoke feature development, hop onto the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/lexicon-forge-is-141128641?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link)—I’ll work with you directly to craft the perfect reading experience.

### For Developers: Self-Hosting
Want to run your own instance? It's easy.

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3.  **Add your API keys** to a new `.env.local` file:
    ```env
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
    VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key_here
    VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_key_here
    VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key # Access to 100+ models including GPT-4o
    VITE_PIAPI_API_KEY=your_piapi_key_here      # For Flux models and LoRA
    # Note: Direct OpenAI support coming soon (requires backend proxy)
    ```
4.  **Run the app:** `npm run dev`

#### Fan Translation Merge (optional)
If you have reference fan translations, you can merge them into an exported session JSON to enable Fan view and provide better context to AI:

```
npm run merge-fan-translations path/to/session.json path/to/fan-translations/ [output.json]
```
The CLI matches files by chapter number, merges them as `fanTranslation`, and prints coverage.
