## 🚀 Getting Started

### The Easy Way: Use the Live Version
The easiest way to start is with the official hosted version on Vercel. No installation required!

**[➡️ Click here to launch LexiconForge](https://lexicon-forge.vercel.app/)**

### For Developers: Self-Hosting
Want to run your own instance? It's easy.

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3.  **Add your API keys** to a new `.env.local` file:
    ```env
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
    VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
    VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key_here
    VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_key_here
    ```
4.  **Run the app:** `npm run dev`

#### Fan Translation Merge (optional)
If you have reference fan translations, you can merge them into an exported session JSON to enable Fan view and provide better context to AI:

```
npm run merge-fan-translations path/to/session.json path/to/fan-translations/ [output.json]
```
The CLI matches files by chapter number, merges them as `fanTranslation`, and prints coverage.

### Technical Architecture
LexiconForge uses a sophisticated **dual-tier data architecture**:
- **Zustand Store**: Sub-millisecond UI reactivity for active session
- **IndexedDB**: Unlimited persistent storage for chapter library and translations
- **Professional Export System**: EPUB generation with comprehensive statistics and embedded illustrations
- **Multi-Provider AI Integration**: Unified interface for 4 major AI providers with advanced illustration pipeline

Prompts & JSON schema descriptions are centralized in `config/prompts.json`, so you can quickly change the HTML rules, footnote/illustration requirements, DeepSeek JSON guard, fan-translation preface, translate preface, and history labels without touching code.

For detailed technical information, see the [Project Structure & Technical Details](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md).
