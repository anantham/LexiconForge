# LexiconForge: Your Personal AI-Powered Web Novel Translator

**Tired of waiting for official translations? Wish you could continue the story right after the anime or manga ends?**

LexiconForge is your gateway to the world of web novels. It's a powerful, AI-driven tool that lets you translate chapters from almost any source, in any language, and customize the reading experience to be *exactly* how you like it. Break down the language barriers and dive into the original stories.
