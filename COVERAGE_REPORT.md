   - Illustration validation: 12 tests

### Critical Gaps 🚨

#### 1. **ChapterView.tsx (6.93% coverage)**
**Impact:** CRITICAL - This is the main translation display component

**Uncovered functionality:**
- Translation rendering logic (lines 1-568, 571-1933)
- Diff marker integration
- Inline editing
- Feedback popover interactions
- Image/audio integration

**Recommendation:** Priority #1 for coverage improvement

#### 2. **Translation Provider Adapters (<10% coverage)**
**Impact:** HIGH - Core translation functionality

**Uncovered:**
- OpenAI API calls (4.53%)
- Gemini API calls (6.62%)
- Claude API calls (33.33%)
- Error handling
- Retry logic
- Token counting

**Recommendation:** Add integration tests or expand unit tests with mocked APIs

#### 3. **App.tsx (0% coverage)**
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Entry point and routing

**Missing:**
- App initialization
- Route handling
- Global state setup
- Error boundaries

**Recommendation:** Add E2E tests or component integration tests

#### 4. **Input/Navigation Components (0% coverage)**
**Impact:** MEDIUM - User interaction flows

**Uncovered:**
- `InputBar.tsx`: URL input and validation
- `LandingPage.tsx`: Initial user experience
- Navigation controls

## 📈 Recent Improvements

### Newly Added: Tag Balancing Tests ✅
- **File:** `tests/components/tag-balancing.test.ts`
- **Coverage:** 8 tests, all passing
- **Covers:** Multi-paragraph HTML formatting across paragraph boundaries

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Path Coverage (2-3 weeks)
1. **ChapterView.tsx** - Add component tests for:
   - Translation rendering
   - Diff marker display
   - Inline editing flows
   - Target: 50%+ coverage

2. **Provider Adapters** - Add integration tests:
   - Mock API responses
   - Error scenarios
   - Token counting validation
   - Target: 60%+ coverage

### Priority 2: User Flows (1-2 weeks)
3. **E2E Tests** for critical paths:
   - Load URL → Translate → View → Export
   - Diff analysis workflow
   - Audio/image generation

4. **Input/Navigation** - Add component tests:
   - URL validation
   - Chapter navigation
   - Target: 40%+ coverage

### Priority 3: Robustness (1 week)
5. **App.tsx** - Add initialization tests
6. **SessionInfo.tsx** - Add statistics display tests
7. **Audio/Image components** - Add integration tests

### Quick Wins (Days)
- Add simple smoke tests for 0% coverage components
- Test error boundaries
- Test loading states

## 💡 Testing Strategy Recommendations

### 1. Component Testing Approach
```typescript
// Example: ChapterView component test structure
describe('ChapterView', () => {
  describe('Translation Rendering', () => {
    it('renders plain text paragraphs')
    it('handles multi-paragraph italic tags') // ✅ Already covered
    it('displays footnote markers')
    it('embeds illustrations')
  })

  describe('Diff Markers', () => {
    it('displays diff gutter when enabled')
    it('shows marker tooltips on hover')
    it('filters markers by visibility settings')
  })
})
```

### 2. Integration Testing
- Mock translation APIs at network level
- Test full translation → display → export pipeline
- Validate state management across components

### 3. E2E Testing (Consider adding)
- Playwright or Cypress for critical user journeys
- Smoke tests for production builds
- Visual regression testing for UI components

---

## 🏆 Well-Tested Modules (Keep as Examples)

1. **DiffAnalysisService** - Good model for service testing
2. **Repository layer** - Excellent data layer coverage
3. **EPUB Templates** - Comprehensive serialization tests
4. **Tag Balancing** - Good example of edge case coverage

---

## 📝 Notes

- **8 skipped tests** in legacy test files (expected)
- **372 passing tests** - good foundation
- **Branch coverage (62.67%)** is better than statement coverage - suggests conditional logic is tested but execution paths are missed
- **Function coverage (28.67%)** indicates many exported functions are untested

---

## 🚀 Action Items

- [ ] Create ChapterView integration test suite
- [ ] Add provider adapter mocked API tests
- [ ] Set up E2E test framework (optional)
- [ ] Add smoke tests for 0% coverage components
- [ ] Establish CI coverage reporting
- [ ] Set coverage gates (e.g., no PR if drops below threshold)

---

**Next Steps:** Focus on ChapterView.tsx and provider adapters as highest priority items.
