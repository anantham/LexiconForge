> **Next steps:** Prioritize rewriting the failing suites highlighted above (nullSafety, navigation, EPUB templates, translator, jobsSlice, cost-calculation) and evaluate the `current-system` + `db/contracts` suites for relevance versus maintenance effort. This manifest should be updated after each triage session.
