## Observations & Buckets
- **Stale DTO shapes (IndexedDB + migrations):** `services/db/**/*`, `services/indexeddb.ts`, and fixtures under `tests/utils` account for 35% of diagnostics. Missing properties and mismatched migration adapters dominate the TS2339/TS2353 noise.
- **Translator pipeline drift:** `services/translationService.ts`, `services/translate/Translator.ts`, and the associated tests are hitting TS2345/TS2322 due to widened parameter types and provider contract changes.
- **Worker + EPUB surfaces:** `workers/epub.worker.ts` and `services/epub/dataCollector.ts` share outdated message payload typings, producing TS2304/TS2740 errors.
- **Store slices & selectors:** `store/slices/{chapters,export,jobs}.ts` plus their tests throw TS2339 where inferred state no longer matches the expanded slices.
- **UI touchpoints:** `components/NovelLibrary.tsx` and `components/InputBar.tsx` reflect the same state-shape issues seen in the slices, but concentrated around hydration effects and new props.

Each cluster maps neatly to a domain we can tackle independently while keeping other areas untouched.

## Next Steps Checklist
1. **Decide canonical DTO interfaces** in `types/db.ts` (or a new `types/db/records.ts`) covering chapters, translations, summaries, URL mappings, and migration payloads.
2. **Refactor the DB layer** (`services/indexeddb.ts`, `services/db/operations/*`, `services/db/migration/*`) to consume those interfaces, removing ad-hoc type assertions.
3. **Refresh translator contracts** by codifying `TranslationRequest`, `TranslationResult`, and provider adapter outputs, then align the translator service + tests.
4. **Stabilize worker message typings** by introducing shared `workerMessages.ts` types consumed by `workers/epub.worker.ts` and EPUB services.
5. **Realign store slices** with explicit `State` interfaces and selectors, then update fixtures/tests (`tests/store/**/*`, `tests/utils/test-data.ts`).
6. **Introduce per-domain TS gates** (e.g., `npm run tsc -- --project tsconfig.json --noEmit --pretty false --types services/db/index.ts`) once a domain is green, and track allow-listed exceptions via a curated `types/ts-errors-allowlist.json`.

Progress against this checklist will be captured in `docs/WORKLOG.md` and a forthcoming ADR describing the clean-up protocol.
