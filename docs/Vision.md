Here is an aspirational vision document for your project, synthesizing the technical features, UX affordances, and philosophical underpinnings you’ve outlined.

Project Indra’s Net: The Holographic Translation Protocol

From Linear Consumption to High-Bandwidth Interoperation

1. The Problem: The "Flatland" of Linear Translation

For centuries, translation has been an exercise in lossy compression. To move an idea from Source Language A (Pali, Korean, or Rationalist Jargon) to Target Language B (English), we have been forced to collapse a 3D cloud of meaning into a 1D string of text.

When a Web Novel translator chooses the word "Parade" instead of "Welcome Party," they aren't just picking a synonym; they are making an executive decision that hides the cultural connotation of the original text. When a Pali scholar translates Ekāyano as "The Direct Path," they silence the valid simultaneous meanings of "The Solitary Path" and "The Convergent Path."

Current text interfaces force us to trust the translator completely. They hide the wires. They force ontological commitments—demanding we use "is" or "was" (English time-anchors) where the source language implies a timeless void. This creates a "false negative" understanding of reality, where we read the words but miss the architecture of the thought.

2. The Vision: Holographic Text

Project Indra’s Net is a "Just-in-Time" interface for high-bandwidth cognition. It rejects the idea that a text has a single, static state. Instead, it treats text as a living, interactive map that allows the reader to traverse the space between cultures and subcultures.

We are not building a reader; we are building a Bridge-Building Engine.

3. The Core UX Pillars
A. The Quantum Word Object (Polysemy Rotator)

In complex languages, ambiguity is a feature, not a bug.

The Mechanism: Key words are rendered as interactive nodes. Ekāyano is not just "Direct."

The Interaction: Clicking the word rotates through valid states: Direct 
→
→
 Solitary 
→
→
 Convergent.

The Ripple: As the user rotates the meaning, the surrounding sentence grammatically re-aligns. "This is the direct path" might shift to "This path for one," allowing the user to feel the semantic tension the original speaker intended.

B. The Transparent Loom (Ghost Elements)

English is an analytic language obsessed with the verb "to be" and rigid word order. Pali (and others) are fusional and synthetic.

The Mechanism: Words that English requires but the Source omits (Zero Copula, articles, prepositions) are rendered at 30% opacity.

The Insight: They are non-selectable "ghosts." They guide the eye but visually confess: "I am a scaffold necessary for your English mind, not a truth of the original text."

C. The Biological Jigsaw (Visual Syntax)

We replace linear word order with visual logic to show deep structure.

The Palette: Instead of arcane labels like "Genitive" or "Instrumental," we use a primal color logic:

Gold (Ownership): Sattānaṁ glows gold to show it possesses the purification.

Blue (Direction): Nibbānassa glows blue to show movement toward.

Orange (Agency): Shows the tool or energy used.

The Tether: On hover, invisible edges light up, drawing lines between the noun and its modifier, identifying the "bones" of the sentence regardless of where they sit in the paragraph.

D. The Comparative Heatmap (Trust but Verify)

We do not trust the "Black Box" of AI or the bias of a single human translator.

The Mechanism: A diff-heatmap that runs the AI translation against a Fan Translation (or multiple AI models).

The Trigger: Subtle color coding next to paragraphs indicates divergence. This sparks curiosity: Why did the AI hesitate here? Why did the human choose this word? It turns passive reading into active inquiry.

4. The Philosophical Goal: Semantic Interoperability

This project is bigger than translation; it is about Interoperability between Reality Tunnels.

In the age of AI, we face an explosion of subcultures (echo chambers), each generating their own jargon, rituals, and values. A "Rationalist" speaking about calibration and a "Poet" speaking about attunement may be pointing at the same truth, but their language prohibits connection.

By distinguishing Content (the root insight) from Packaging (the medium/style), this interface allows us to re-publish wisdom in a way that integrates with the local context of the receiver.

5. Roadmap: The Evolution of the Tool

Phase 1: Lexicon Forge (The MVP):

Vibe-coding an interface for Web Novels.

Establishing the pipeline: Scrape 
→
→
 Contextual Translation 
→
→
 Diff-View 
→
→
 Image Generation.

Building confidence in the "Target Language" (English) via features like music integration and plot visualization.

Phase 2: SuttaStudio (The Deep Dive):

Moving from entertainment to study.

Implementing the "Anatomist" features: Root/Stem decomposition (Sati + Paṭṭhāna).

Implementing the "Prayer List": Deconstruct 
→
→
 Blowup 
→
→
 Syntax mapping.

Phase 3: Indra’s Net (The Protocol):

A generalized interface where any text can be subjected to this scrutiny.

A community-driven "Living Glossary" where definitions are debated and refined, creating a map of how words relate across different psychological and cultural territories.

6. Conclusion

We are moving from a world where we passively receive a translation, to a world where we actively meet the source text. We provide the affordances—the cognitive handles—for a user to climb the wall of a foreign language and peek over the top, even if they cannot speak it fluently.

This is how we ensure that as the world fragments, meaning does not shatter; it only refracts.
