## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Catalog Registry** (`config/novelCatalog.ts`)
   - Novels stored as structured metadata
   - Each entry points to a hosted session JSON file

2. **Import Service** (`services/importService.ts`)
   - Fetches session JSON from URLs
   - Validates format and structure
   - Handles CORS, timeouts, and errors
   - Supports GitHub, Google Drive, and custom URLs

3. **State Management**
   - Landing page shows when no session active
   - Main app shows after successful import
   - Seamless transition (no page reload)

### Session JSON Structure

Each novel is stored as a complete session export containing:
- All chapter content (raw text)
- Existing translations
- Navigation links
- Metadata and settings
- Compressed and validated format

### Hosting Requirements

Session JSONs are hosted on:
- **GitHub** (recommended) - Free, fast, version controlled
- **Custom CDN** - Any CORS-enabled static host
- **Cloud Storage** - S3, R2, Google Drive (with sharing)

## FAQ

### Q: Can I add my own novel to the library?
**A:** Yes! Export your session JSON and host it on GitHub. Then either:
- Submit a PR to add it to the catalog
- Share the direct import URL: `?import=YOUR_URL`

### Q: How large can a session JSON be?
**A:** ImportService has a 50MB limit. For larger novels (100+ chapters), consider splitting into volumes.

### Q: What if a novel URL is broken?
**A:** The catalog will show an error. You can still use the manual URL input fallback on the landing page.

### Q: Can I update a novel's translation?
**A:** Yes! Re-export the session JSON, replace the file on GitHub, and users will get the updated version on next load.

### Q: Do novels stay cached?
**A:** Yes! After first load, chapters are stored in IndexedDB. The library helps discover new content, but previously loaded novels persist locally.
