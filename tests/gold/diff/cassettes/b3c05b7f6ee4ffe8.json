    "text": "You are a translation alignment analyst. Compare the AI translation against the raw source text and an optional fan translation. Work paragraph-by-paragraph using the provided chunk IDs.\n\n== INPUT: AI TRANSLATION (CHUNKED) ==\n[para-0-6cec]: The ancient castle, built over 500 years ago by the legendary King Arthur, stood majestically on the hill.\n\n== INPUT: FAN TRANSLATION (FULL) ==\nThe old castle stood on the hill.\n\n== INPUT: RAW SOURCE TEXT (FULL) ==\n古い城が丘の上に立っていた。\n\n== PRIOR FEEDBACK ==\n(No previous feedback)\n\nColor semantics (apply as many as needed per chunk):\n- red: \"missing-context\" or \"plot-omission\" — AI translation is missing substantive information that exists in the raw text.\n- orange: \"added-detail\" or \"hallucination\" — AI translation invents or embellishes beyond the raw text.\n- blue: \"fan-divergence\" — AI translation diverges from the fan translation (wording, nuance, emphasis) while staying faithful to the raw.\n- purple: \"sensitivity-filter\" — AI translation sanitizes or removes explicit violence/sexual or otherwise sensitive details present in the fan translation.\nGrey is implicitly assumed when none of the above differences apply. Do NOT output grey markers.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Review each chunk in order. Only emit output for chunks that need red, orange, blue, or purple.\n2. When a chunk needs multiple colors, include all relevant reasons.\n3. Provide an \"explanations\" array aligned 1:1 with the colors array (one justification sentence per color).\n4. Include a confidence score between 0 and 1 (omit if unsure).\n5. Format the response as strict JSON (no comments, markdown, or trailing commas).\n\nResponse schema:\n{\n  \"markers\": [\n    {\n      \"chunkId\": \"para-12-a1b2\",\n      \"colors\": [\"red\", \"purple\"],\n      \"reasons\": [\"missing-context\", \"sensitivity-filter\"],\n      \"explanations\": [\"Raw text mentions Lady Gamigin fainting repeatedly, which the AI omits.\", \"Fan translation retains explicit phrasing that the AI softens.\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.82\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nIf no chunk requires red/orange/blue/purple, respond with {\"markers\": []}.\n\n== COLOR EXAMPLES ==\nAs you will recieve some input like this \n\n== INPUT: AI TRANSLATION (CHUNKED) ==\n[para-0-7097]: “Dantalian, you are far too wicked.”\n\n[para-1-3fa1]: We were aboard a small ferry. It was painted a clean, immaculate white. The boat traced endlessly gentle ripples as we drifted down the river, comfortable thanks to the water spirit towing us beneath the hull.\n\n[para-2-1a50]: While I was at it, I let my hand slip higher—then higher still. From her wrist, up along her arm in a slow glide. Paimon leaned into me like a cat and welcomed the touch. At last, her red hair flowed silk-smooth between my fingers.\n\n[para-12-5v45] : We remained in the garden, making love from evening until dawn. Gamigin fainted dozens of times, but her womanhood had grown so hypersensitive that each thrust’s jolt kept dragging her back before she could fully pass out.\n\n[para-8-2id4] : So it went. Just as scholars sang of world peace from the vantage of their own convictions, so too did Emperor Henri of Frankia, Queen Henrietta of Brittany, Demon Lord Barbatos, and Demon Lord Agares cling to their own perspectives.\n\n[para-18-4w76] : “Sir Dantalian,” Lapis said, expressionless. “You have been seeking narcotics more and more often. You drink wine too frequently. And of late, you have even abused aphrodisiacs. I heard from Sir Jeremi that you request drug formulations at all hours.” \n\n\n----\n\nHERE ARE EXAMPLES FOR EACH COLOR \n\n\nMissing vs. raw source\n(red)\n\n\"missing-context\" or \"plot-omission\" — AI translation is missing substantive information that exists in the raw text.\n\n\n1) Henry, Henrietta, Barbatos, and Agares each simply clung to their own view.\n\nExplanation - \"Important context on who these people are is missing!\"\n\n\nAdded beyond raw source\n\n# (orange)\n\n \"added-detail\" or \"hallucination\" — AI translation invents or embellishes beyond the raw text. Maybe for dramatic effect, for sake of the story. \n\n1) As the scholars kept hymning peace from the safety of their own theses, so too did the great players cling to their lenses: Henry of Frankia polishing the empire’s tarnished sigil, Henrietta of Brittany weighing crown against coastline, and the demon lords Barbatos and Agares sharpening old grudges like knives. Each gazed through a private keyhole and swore it was the whole horizon.\n\n사정은 이러했다. 학자들이 자신의 관점을 고수함으로써 대륙 평화를 노래하듯이, 꼭 그처럼 프랑크의 황제 앙리, 브르타뉴의 여왕 앙리에타, 마왕 바르바토스, 마왕 아가레스――그들 전부 자신들의 관점을 고수할 따름이었다.\n\n\nExplanation - \"The details of what they were doing are not mentioned in the raws\"\n\n---\n\n\nSensitive details\n\n# (purple)\n\nAI translation sanitizes or removes explicit violence/sexual or otherwise politically incorrect details present in the fan translation. This is moral policing of a kind.\n\n\n\n1) 그날 저녁부터 시작하여 새벽이 될 때까지 그대로 정원에서 섹스했다. 가미긴은 도중에 수십 번 기절해버렸다. 그러나 예민해질 대로 예민해진 질구가 육봉에 쑤셔지자, 그녀는 제대로 기절하지도 못했다.\n\nExplanation - “womanhood” isn’t idiomatic modern English, and “making love\" is an attempt to downplay the raw sexual scene\n\n\n---\n\nFan translation divergence\n\n# (blue)\n\n\"fan-divergence\" — AI translation diverges from the fan translation (wording, nuance, emphasis, glossary of terms)\n\n\n1) Similar to the scholars who sung about the peace of the world by adhering to their own perspectives, Henry the Emperor of Frankia, Henrietta the Queen of Brittany, Demon Lord Barbatos, and Demon Lord Agares━all of these people adhered to their own perspectives as well.\n\n사정은 이러했다. 학자들이 자신의 관점을 고수함으로써 대륙 평화를 노래하듯이, 꼭 그처럼 프랑크의 황제 앙리, 브르타뉴의 여왕 앙리에타, 마왕 바르바토스, 마왕 아가레스――그들 전부 자신들의 관점을 고수할 따름이었다.\n\nExplanation - The name used is Henry in the fan translation so here we see a term change.\n\n---\n\nNo substantive differences (implicit fallback). Grey is implicitly assumed when none of the above differences apply. Do NOT output grey markers.\n\n# (grey)\n\n“단탈리안은 성격이 너무 악독하와요.”\n\n\n우리는 나룻배에 올라타 있었다. 하얀색으로 깔끔하고 단정하게 채색된 나룻배. 한없이 부드러운 물결을 그리면서 강을 타고 흘렀다. 물의 정령이 배밑을 잡고 이끌어주는 덕분에 편안했다.\n\n라피스가 무표정하게 말했다.\n“마약을 찾으시는 일이 점점 증가하고 있습니다. 포도주도 지나치게 자주 드시고 계십니다. 최근 들어서는 미약과 같은 약물까지 남용하시지 않습니까. 제레미 경에게 들었습니다. 단탈리안 님께서 시도때도 없이 약물 제조를 의뢰하신다고.”"
